#WHAT IS A/B TESTING?
Basically [A/B testin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFMgpxG-chM) is the proces of optimization of a website and improve it to according to needs of the company. A/B testing is definitely not a ‚Äúone time thing‚Äù. It should be a continuous practice/culture for companies to be able to keep in touch with users for an extended periods of time.
#STEPS OF A/B TESTING
Step 1: Problem Definition
Every company have different business models and it is quite natural for companies to ask different questions to be able to unleash the fullmight of A/B testing.  
What is your website for? If you could make your website do one thing better, what would it do?
Increasing average donations per visitor for a fund-raising website, reveneu per visitor for e-commerce could be potential goals and we can use A/B testing to reach these goals.

# DICTIONARY/TERMINOLOGY
Abandonment: User leaving the website without doing anything. It can be good (the page was really good and nobody clicked anythng.) or bad (none of the results looked helpful) depending on the context.
